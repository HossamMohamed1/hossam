## About Me

I have been with **WAKEB** company since November 2022, initially serving as an intern and later advancing to the role of Junior Software Engineer. During my time here, I've been deeply involved in Laravel projects, notably contributing to the development of a Visit Management System. This system streamlines visitor management, materials requests, and car requests, with added AI capabilities for automatic check-in and check-out processes, including AI-based car plate scanning. Additionally, I have designed and implemented various dashboards catering to different user roles, ensuring secure access through role-based permissions.

### Key Contributions:
- Development of Visit Management System
- Integration of AI capabilities for automatic processes
- Design and implementation of role-based dashboards

Apart from my work at **WAKEB**, I've also engaged in freelancing, particularly on a Microservices project as a backend developer. This experience has honed my skills in designing and implementing scalable backend solutions within a Microservices architecture. Collaborating with diverse teams, I've gained insights into distributed systems and delivered effective solutions.
